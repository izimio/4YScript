# How to Find Your Epitech JWT üåê

Follow these steps to locate your Epitech JWT (JSON Web Token):

1. **Connect to your Epitech Intra Account:**
   - Access your Epitech Intra account through the official website.

2. **Open the Dev Console:**
   - Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press `F12` to open the browser's developer console.

3. **Navigate to the "Application" Section:**
   - In the developer console, find and select the "Application" tab.

4. **Explore the Cookies Section:**
   - Look for the üç™ Cookies accordion and expand it.

5. **Access Epitech Intra Cookies:**
   - Locate and click on the cookies associated with `https://intra.epitech.eu/`.

6. **Find Your JWT:**
   - In the list of cookies, search for the "user" row.
   - Retrieve the value; it should start with something resembling `eyJ0eXA...`.

Note: Ensure that you keep your JWT secure and do not share it with others. This token is sensitive information that provides access to your Epitech Intra account.
